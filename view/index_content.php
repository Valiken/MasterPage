                <p>My goal for this site is to make it easy for you to find all of the information you need about me and my work.</p>

                    <h2>Hello...</h2>
                    <p>My name is Brian Berg and I am currently a CIS major at Cal Poly Pomona. I am slated to graduate in December 2013 and am actively looking 
                        for any internship or job opportunity that comes my way. I am really looking forward to being out in the world and learning the ins and 
                        outs of programming, web development, and project management. This site is still a work in progress and will be for at least a few more 
                        months while I get the design hammered out and get all of the content updated and fleshed out. But I hope that you like what you can see so far! </p>

                    <h2>What you'll find...</h2>
                    <p>Is a portfolio of the work that I have completed throughout my school career as well as various other projects that I have taken on, 
                        such as, the IT Competition held by MISSA at Cal Poly Pomona. You will also find my resume laid out in an easy to read format, as well as,
                         a download link to a word document of it. Along with that I have included some information about how I came to create this site and some 
                         background on me and my interests. I hope that you enjoy my website and what it has to offer. </p>
