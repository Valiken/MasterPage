                <p>Once again hello, my name is Brian Berg. I am currently a senior at Cal Poly Pomona and I am slated to graduate in Fall 2013. My current focus of study is both web development and programming. Oddly enough when I first started down this path I hated programming, but the more I have been exposed to it the more I seem to enjoy the challenge and feeling of accomplishment you get from creating something from scratch. I currently live at home with my parents and our two dogs in Burbank, California. I am a hard worker, and if I can't get something to work the first time around I will continue to plug away at it until it works how I want it to.</p>

                <h4>About the site...</h4>
                <p>I decided to create this site because the old template that I was using was too busy for what i wanted my website to convey.
                    So when my friend gave me a link to a tutorial about using twitter bootstrap I thought it would be the perfect way to redesign my site to handle my information in a clear and concise manner.
                    The reason I picked bootstrap over anything else was because it came with a lot of great features and it came with a nice basic template that was easy to flesh out. While I'm still working on 
                    the overall layout, colors, and content I am happy with the progress that I've made so far.
