                <p>This project was made in an Introduction to CIS class that I had to take when I transfered to Cal Poly Pomona. Since I was the only one who knew anything about HTML or CSS on my team I was tasked with creating the site. 
                    I built it off of the most basic template I could find and designed it from there. I was fairly happy with the project, even if it is very basic in design and implementation.</p>
